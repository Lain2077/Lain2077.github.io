							<h2><strong>INTENTIONS</strong></h2>
						  <p>Etheralis is a project about mass surveillance and privacy. After being registered, users in the room are constantly being identified and asked to perform certain tasks every now and then. An ID score system, as well as the room environment varies in relation with tasks success and failure.
							<br> <br> 
							People tended to forget about the system, and just enjoy the ambience before their next task. While our surveillance system is reduced to a playful state, we wanted to highlight how we often forget about these very real mass-surveillance systems out there, as well as how easy it is to deploy one.</p>
							<h2><strong>SYSTEM</strong></h2>
							<p>To complete the task at hand of identifying multiple people simultaneously on consumer hardware, there is nothing I could find online that would perfectly fit the job. It was therefore needed to create our own system, while making sure that it is as performant as it can get.
							<br> <br>
							By using PyTorch, OpenCV built with CUDA support, Facenet (Model), and well managing our data transfers to avoid passing through the CPU as much as possible, we were able to achieve a quite-performant real-time multi-face identification system on an <strong>RTX 4070.</strong>
							<br><br>
							The picture you see above is a log of Etheralis identifying the 43 faces on screen at once with little accuracy error. During real-context deployment, we were running the completely treated feed at around 19 FPS. A function was created to update and append a new database entry in real-time. 
							<br><br>
							The rest of the system includes data treatment, the task assigner and checker, the ID score system, room lighting and sound control, and visuals. All of these were implemented with TouchDesigner. The visuals were displayed with MadMapper</p>
