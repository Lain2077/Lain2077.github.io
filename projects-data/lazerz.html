						  <p>As part of an event for the 15th anniversary of Le Culte and L'Incubateur, I really wanted to play with lasers as for once there was an opportunity.
							<br> <br> 
							I was aiming for a gamified architecture where it would be nothing but fun to control the lasers at hand. As seen in the picture above, two class 1 (Eye-safe) lasers were used. I opted for a controller as an input devices for combinations. In the end, I started to pass the controller around for other people to have fun. The fact that this deployment was very user-friendly made it very enjoyable for anyone that tried it.</p>
							<h2><strong>SYSTEM</strong></h2>
							<p>The two lasers work via DMX. Anyone who tried DMX lasers before know it is not such an easy task to program all of the parameters on the fly. I opted for a sort of config approach, in order to make sure that setting up the different effects was easy once the whole system is done.

							The whole patch is contained within this screenshot. The yellow bricks are pre-scaled values of the joysticks to have all the possible rotation/translation behaviors at hand. The data processing occurs at any controller value change, and bases itself on the config to then pass the corresponding values to the DMX channels of both lasers. Note that the config supports combinations, which is the reason why I have chosen a controller to exploit most of what the laser can offer within one fun controlling device.
